# Branch Strategy

## Main Branches
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development integration branch

## Feature Branches
- `feature/team-assignment`: Team assignment system
- `feature/match-system`: Match management system
- `feature/tournament-flow`: Tournament progression logic

## Branch Rules
1. All development work happens in feature branches
2. Feature branches are created from `develop`
3. Pull requests are required to merge into `develop`
4. `develop` merges into `main` for releases
5. Version tags are created on `main`

## Commit Guidelines
1. Use descriptive commit messages
2. Include the feature/component in the commit title
3. Provide detailed descriptions for significant changes
4. Reference issues/tasks where applicable
