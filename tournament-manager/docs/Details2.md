Project Overview: Tournament Management System
Goal
Create a web application for managing tournaments with functionalities such as user authentication, team assignments, match pairings, ranking systems, and progression through different stages of the tournament. The system should allow participants to enter match results, view their progress, and track the tournament standings.

Features and Logic
1. User Authentication (Login/Sign-Up System)
Purpose: Allow users to log in, register, and access their stored tournament data.
Implementation:
Firebase Authentication (or Node.js with Passport.js if custom backend).
Users can register, log in, and save tournament data associated with their account.
Firebase Authentication can store and manage user credentials securely.
2. Team Assignment Logic (System-Assigned Teams)
Description: This logic is responsible for assigning teams to each participant based on the number of participants.

Number of Teams per Participant:

2 Participants: 12 teams each
3 Participants: 8 teams each
4 Participants: 6 teams each
5 Participants: 4 teams each (Total: 20 teams)
6 Participants: 4 teams each
7 Participants: 2 teams each (Total: 14 teams)
8 Participants: 3 teams each
9 Participants: 2 teams each (Total: 18 teams)
10 Participants: 2 teams each (Total: 20 teams)
11 Participants: 2 teams each (Total: 22 teams)
12 Participants: 2 teams each
Pot Distribution (1 - 4):

1st Pot: Strongest teams
4th Pot: Weakest teams
Team Assignment:

Each participant gets 1 team from each pot, ensuring a balanced tournament structure.
Example for 6 Participants: Each participant gets 1 team from Pot 1, Pot 2, Pot 3, and Pot 4.
3. Match Pairings Logic
Description: Match pairings determine how participants are matched up in each round.

Number of Matches (Based on Participants):

2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 Participants: 12 matches
5 Participants: 10 matches
7 Participants: 7 matches
9 Participants: 9 matches
10 Participants: 10 matches
11 Participants: 11 matches
Pairing Logic:

Participants are shuffled to create random matchups.
Each participant plays against different opponents without repeating matches.
No participant can play against themselves.
4. Ranking System
Ranking Criteria:
Total Points: Points awarded based on match results.
Goal Difference: If points are tied, goal difference is used to break ties.
Goals Scored: If points and goal difference are tied, goals scored will determine rankings.
5. Advancement to Knockout Phase
Advancement Logic:
For 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12 Participants:
Top 16 teams (66.7%) advance to the Knockout Phase (KOP) to determine 8 winners for the Quarter-Finals (QF).
For 5 Participants:
Top 6 teams advance to the Quarter-Finals.
The next 4 teams (7-10) will compete in the Knockout Phase to determine 2 winners who will join the top 6 in the Quarter-Finals.
For 9 Participants:
Top 3 teams advance to the Quarter-Finals.
The next 10 teams (4-13) will compete in the Knockout Phase to determine 5 winners who will join the top 3 in the Quarter-Finals.
For 7 Participants:
Top 8 teams advance directly to the Quarter-Finals.
For 10 Participants:
Same logic as for 5 participants.
6. Match Results Input
Purpose: Allow participants or admins to input match results.
Implementation:
Input form for match results: Scores for both teams.
Error handling for invalid data (e.g., non-numeric values, missing scores).
Results update in the tournament rankings after each match.
Display error messages when invalid data is entered.
7. Progressive UI (Tournament Progress Tracker)
Purpose: Provide users with a visual timeline to track the progress of the tournament.
Implementation:
Use a progress bar or step-by-step timeline showing the stages of the tournament (Group Stage, Knockout Phase, Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals, Finals).
Dynamic updates to show the current stage of the tournament as participants advance.
Highlight the active stage to give users clear visibility on their progress.
8. Match History & Stats
Purpose: Display past match results, team statistics, and rankings.
Implementation:
A Match History page where users can view all match results (team names, scores, dates).
Show key stats such as:
Total Wins, Losses, Draws
Goals Scored and Conceded
Goal Difference
Points (if applicable)
Users can sort match history by date, team, or other criteria.
9. Error Handling
Purpose: Handle edge cases and invalid data entry gracefully.
Implementation:
Input Validation: Ensure participants' names, match scores, and other inputs are valid.
Provide error messages when invalid data is entered (e.g., "Please enter a valid score").
Handle edge cases where the number of participants doesn't match the expected tournament structure (e.g., odd number of participants or missing data).
10. Optional Features
Notification System (Not needed): Notify users when it's their turn to update results or when a tournament phase changes.
Mobile Responsiveness (Not needed): Ensure the UI works well on mobile devices (optional).
Steps to Complete the Project
Step 1: Set up Development Environment
Frontend Setup:
Create the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Set up a framework if needed (e.g., React.js or Angular for complex UI).
Ensure mobile responsiveness for better UX (optional).
Backend Setup (Optional):
Use Node.js and Express for a custom backend or Firebase for serverless authentication and data storage.
Set up Firebase Authentication if using Firebase.
Step 2: Implement Core Features
User Authentication:
Integrate Firebase or custom backend authentication.
Implement login, signup, and user session management.
Team Assignment Logic:
Implement logic to assign teams to participants based on the number of participants.
Match Pairing Logic:
Shuffle participants and create random match pairings.
Implement match result entry and validation.
Ranking System:
Calculate and display rankings based on points, goal difference, and goals scored.
Tournament Progress Tracker:
Create a visual tracker to show progress through the tournament stages.
Step 3: Enhance User Experience
Match Results Input UI:

Create a clean and intuitive form for entering match results.
Match History & Stats:

Create a page to display past results and stats.
Error Handling:

Implement thorough validation for data entry (e.g., preventing invalid scores).
Step 4: Testing and Deployment
Testing:
Test the system thoroughly for edge cases and ensure the match logic, rankings, and user authentication work smoothly.
Deployment:
Host the app on a platform like Firebase Hosting, Heroku, or Netlify.
Ensure proper routing and responsiveness.
